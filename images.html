        <i>Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a
            variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls
            have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex.
            These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation
            systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s
            are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the
            combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in
            the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and
            are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[8][9]
            The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently
            in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[10] such as Project
            Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.</i>
